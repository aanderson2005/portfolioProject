            <h1>Meet Anthony Anderson - Graphic Designer</h1>
          <p class="paragraph">To Anthony Anderson, being a designer means more than creating visually appealing work. It’s about telling stories, and expressing passion through visuals.<br> <br>
        As a Visual Communication Design major at San Francisco State University, Anthony views design as a powerful tool to connect with others, evoke emotion, and celebrate the things he loves, especially 
        his admiration for the San Francisco Giants. Anthony’s creativity is fueled from his lifelong love of San Francisco Giants baseball. He attended the Giants’ 2010 World Series parade at age five, and witnessed game 162 of the 
        remarkable 107-win season in 2021. These memories drive his work on his Instagram fan page, where he’s cultivated a following of over 9,000 since 2023. He finds motivation in the excitement of sports, 
        the energy of live games, and the responses his designs spark among fellow fans. <br> <br>
        Currently residing in Daly City, California, Anthony previously lived in South San Francisco. His background has shaped his perspective as both a designer and a person. Growing up in the Bay Area impacted
         him with a strong sense of community and pride, both of which are evident in his work and goals. He values authenticity and aims to create meaningful, visually rich experiences through his work. 
         After graduation, Anthony envisions himself working in a field that combines his design skills and personal interests; most likely in sports media, branding, or digital content creation. He is passionate about
         design, storytelling, baseball, music, video games, and food, which play key roles in shaping his identity and desires. With a vision and deep love for what he does, Anthony is committed to making an 
         impact through his creativity and passion.
