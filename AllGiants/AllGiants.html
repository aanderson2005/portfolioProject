      <h1> What is All SF Giants?</h1>
    <p>Created in 2023, Anthony decided to create a platform dedicated to his favorite sports team, the San Francisco Giants. He really admired 
        the sports graphics he sees on social media, and he <br>thought it would be a great way to express his feelings about the team, while also posting
    lineups, news, and updates about the Giants. 
<br> <br>Anthony saw the joy in making these graphics. His account grew as he continued to post, as he gained more followers and engagement. He currently has certain Giants
minor league players following the account, and he is very proud of that. He first noticed his account was growing when former Giants bench coach, and former 3rd base coach, Ron Wotus
    followed him. Some of Anthony's content has gone viral, with notable players, such as star outfielder Jung-Hoo Lee, and starting pitcher Hayden Birdsong liking his posts.
    With the Giants hot start to the 2025 season, Anthony is excited to see how the rest of the season plays out. He hopes to continue to grow his account, as his goal is to reach 10,000 followers
    by the end of the season.
